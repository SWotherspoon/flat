This package provides smooths for mgcv that are constrained to be flat at on or both of the end knots.

## Installation

You can install the development version of flat like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("SWotherspoon/flat")
```

## Usage

These smoothers are used with `gam` much like any other smoothers, but the user must supply knots.  
The vignette provides examples.
